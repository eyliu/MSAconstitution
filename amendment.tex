\section{Ratification.}
    This Constitution shall be ratified immediately with the consent of three-fifths of voting students. All officers filling any office by election or appointment at the time of ratification shall continue to exercise their powers and duties until their successors are selected in accordance with this constitution or the measures enacted pursuant thereto. All officers elected concurrently with ratification shall take office and complete the term to which they were elected under the All-Campus Constitution of 1986 and existing codes and continue to serve until their successors are elected pursuant to this constitution. The sitting student government at the time of ratification shall adopt operating procedures, election regulations, and such changes as may be necessary to adapt student government to this constitution by March 2011. Student government shall not adopt any amendments to the All-Campus Constitution of 1986 and shall not amend this constitution before April 2011.

\section{Amendments.}
    The Central Student Legislature may present amendments to this Constitution to the students by a two-thirds majority of the Assembly and a two-thirds majority of the University Council. After such passage, the Elections Committee shall arrange for a special election of the students. If, during such special election, three-fifth of voting students shall vote to affirm the amendment, it will be enacted.
