\article{Student Governance}
\section{Authority.}
    All authority under this Constitution is derived directly from the students.

\section{Governments.}
    All student governance powers granted herein shall vest in a Central Student Government. The Central Student Government shall be democratically constituted, and shall consist of central legislative, executive, and judicial powers. All student governance powers not granted herein shall devolve to the additional governments for each school or college, University-owned and operated housing (and for each individual house and building therein), fraternities, sororities, and cooperatives; and for such jurisdictions as the smallest government containing the jurisdiction shall certify. The creation, structure, functions, and operations of each government shall be determined by the government's student constituency.

    Each student government or organization, each housing unit, and each federation of student governments, organizations, or housing units shall have a constitution approved by the students within the jurisdiction of the government, organization, housing unit, or federation providing for the democratic selection of its leadership and representative and democratic policy making within the government, organization, housing unit, or federation. Each such democratically constituted government shall be the governmental representative, legislative, and coordinating organization of the students of that jurisdiction, shall, upon a majority vote of its student constituents levy dues, and provide for their collection equally from each of the student constituents of the government; shall appropriate its own dues money and such other income as it shall receive; shall make appointments of student representatives to all student seats on committees whose purview is coextensive with the jurisdiction containing that committee; and  shall conduct its elections so as to insure that its constituents are given ample opportunity to cast their ballots, that the election is free from fraud and that open campaigning can take place.

    All general sessions of student government bodies recognized under this Constitution shall be open to students at large. Any body may enter closed session by a majority vote, but shall not take any votes of substance while in closed session.
 
\section{Supremacy.}
    This Constitution and the Compiled Code which shall be made in pursuance thereof under the Central Student Government or other student governments on this campus shall hold supremacy over any provision of another student code, and judges and justices of student courts shall be bound thereby.

\section{Elections.}
    The Central Student Government shall have the power to hold elections for its offices and for referenda, coordinate with other governments elections for the offices of those governments, and regulate campaign practices on campus. Elections for Central Student Government offices shall be twice each year, once in November and once in March. Each term of office shall begin ten days after the election in which the seat was filled has been certified. Elections shall be administered and certified by a University Elections Committee, which will serve at the direction of the Student General Counsel. The Student General Counsel shall have the authority to hire an elections administrator.

    For bodies represented by a proportional count of students, including the Student Assembly, the Student General Counsel shall present to the Assembly and the students the apportionment for each such body no less than one month before each scheduled election.

    No representative may run for election or hold office representing a constituency of which that person is not a member. Students enrolled or actively working toward their degree shall be held to be members of the constituency in which they are so engaged.
